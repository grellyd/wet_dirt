You are lying down. A small hour glass lies in front of you, partially buried in sand. What do you do?

>pick up hourglass

you gently pluck a small hourglass from the ground. It is delicately carved from what appears to be a white stone, curling spirals twist around the central glass. Upon holding it upright the black sands it contains begin flowing gently upwards as if counting time in inverse. It feels cool in your hands.

[get hourglass in your inventory]

>stand, look,up

You are standing in glittering soft sands the color of tarnished copper. [IF NOT YET PICKED UP: small hour glass lies nestled in sand in front of you.] Distant dunes ripple softly with the listless breeze, ever transforming under the heavy heat of the sun. To the North there is an iridescent glass tower, to the West a stoic grey stone tower, to the East a jet obsidian tower. They stand immense, appearing to concave upwards as they stretch towards the sun. What do you do?

THE GLASS TOWER

The coolness of the air in the tower is refreshing and surprising after the acrid heat of the desert. The hard glass floors and clear walls reflect and refract light in a varying array of shifting patterns, occasionally with the faintest unnatural glow of subtle purple. Almost difficult to see at first amongst the shimmering surfaces, a glass display case stands in the center of the room.

THE GLASS DISPLAY CASE
The case is mostly bare and gathering dust with only a mahogany box, an odd mechanism of a metal ball standing on a rod, and a small faceted crystal fill its shelves.

>inspect box

inside you find a small metal handle with a square shaped peg on the end.

>take handle

>inspect crystal

The faucets glitter as the stone splits even the faintest light into a dozen little stars. It appears to be made from the same material as the tower, but more densly formed.

>take crystal

>inspect mechanism
A large silver globe mounted on a metal post juts from a complicated metal stand.

>take the mechanism

it won’t budge.

>inspect metal stand

you find a flat round plate that appears to be bolted to the top beneath the rod. Upon further inspection you also find a small square hole in the side of the stand.

>use handle on hole

the handle clicks into place easily, and you feel the slight pull of internal gears catching.

>turn handle

You begin turning the handle, forcing it against the resistance of the internals of the mechanism. A furious whirring gradually grows louder and louder as you pick up momentum. Continue turning the handle?

>y

The gears grind even faster and suddenly a loud crack accompanied by a flash of light so bright it momentarily darkens the rest of the room emits from the metal ball to the bolted plate. Feeling an electrical shock you withdraw your hands involuntarily. As the handle slows its spinning, you notice crystal room seems to glow warmer for several moments before fading back to an ambient sheen.

>place crystal on plate

 >turn handle

You begin turning the handle, forcing it against the resistance of the internals of the mechanism. A furious whirring gradually grows louder and louder as you pick up momentum. Continue turning the handle?

>y

The gears grind even faster and suddenly a loud crack accompanied by a flash of light so bright it momentarily darkens the rest of the room emits from the metal ball to the crystal. The crystal seems to pulse like a heartbeat for several moments, and unlike it's tower counterpart it continues to emit an almost lively glow long after the lighting charge has passed. It seems safe to pick up.

>take crystal

As the stone shimmers in your hand, a great pulse of light moves through the crystal tower. Light dances across the floors and ceilings with a distinct sense of eerie consciousness as if the building recognizes your presence. The beams align on the floor to form the glowing words ‘Three towers really one, one hand really two, two souls a reflection’

THE STONE TOWER

THE CEILING
A round stained glass dome, finely set with glass of muted copper, gold, silver and blue. The curling colours flow in an ornate circle to form a compass adorned with elemental symbols. At North there is curls of wind, At West a a red ball of flame, East with purple swirls of magic and South brown shards of stone. The glass is dark and no light can be seen shining through it.

THE DESK
The desk is heavyset, made with thick marble slabs and inlayed with delicate carvings. It has several hefty looking drawers made from the same stone. The surface of the desk has four carved indentations with a tarnished copper compass mounted in the middle.

>open drawers

you struggle and after several seconds the impractical marble drawers grind open, to reveal several small stone tiles.

>take stone tiles

>inspect stone tiles

The tiles fit comfortably in your palm, carved with images of 4 creatures; a gryphon, a golem, a unicorn and a dragon, all ferociously posed.

>put stone tiles in indentations

which tile up?

>Gryphon

which tile in down?

>Golem

Which tile in right?

>Unicorn

Which tile in left?

>Dragon

As you set down the final tile, there's a deep scraping rumble of rock against rock. Sand and dust litter down from the ceiling in tiny showers and suddenly the room is dappled with blues and golds as light bursts shining through the stained glass ceiling. The light illuminates a small pile of bones, old and bleached with scraps of fabric clinging pitifully to its past owners remains.

>inspect bones

You find a note amongst the remains. In scrawling ancient hand it reads

'In our search of reason, we have lost true meaning- the magi and I have been searching so long, so listlessly to find the fundamentals of what gives magic to this universe that I believe we have lost sight of magic itself.
The preparations are nearly complete. Soon we shall know if the answers we chase are as imaginary as the beasts of legends themselves’

on the opposite side of the note a series of numbers have been hastily recorded with once dripping ink:

[NUMBER PUZZLE ANSWER]


THE OBSIDIAN TOWER

The room is pitch, as if the walls surrounding you consume the light from the outside with an otherworldly hunger. A stillness follows your hollow scraping footsteps on the coarse black shale floor. The room contains a crude basin emanating the only source of haunting red light, by which you can make out an adjacent table height slab with a small deck of cards placed on it.

THE BASIN

>look, inspect

Rising slightly higher than your waist, the hewn obsidian basin appears to be filled equally with two liquids; rippling red molten and clear blue water. The two liquids are separated down the center by two thick marble disks. What do you do?

>inspect disks

the disks are carved deeply with recognizable numerals, and appear to be spinnable.

						I/I
>touch water/lava

an invisible shell repels your touch, apparently also sustaining the contained liquids in a slow swirling pattern despite no outer influence.

THE DECK

>inspect deck

it appears to be a deck of divination cards placed carefully in the center of the table, the shabby black backs imply heavy use by their previous owner. Upon a closer look, you find they are black on both sides.

>inspect table

engraved subtly on the ebony table an inscription reads 'skill of the shuffle, luck of the draw'

>shuffle deck

>draw card/take card
The card reads the 7 of swords
>draw card/take card
The card reads the 7 of coins

>draw card/take card

The deck appears to have melded into one solid entity. No more cards can be drawn.

>put [any card] back on deck/table

[any card] sits on [deck, table]

>put [any card] in basin

[card] sees where you might be going with this, unfortunately the basin does not agree. An invisible shell repels your touch, apparently also sustaining the contained liquids in a slow swirling pattern despite no outer influence.

>enter 7/7 into the marble slab

As the final number locks into place a mechanical click sounds somewhere deep internally from the basin, a few seconds later a blast of scalding steam bursts from its contents- The heat issued from the pedestal is briefly unnaturally intense, and no longer can the shimmer of a forcefield be seen around its brim. The air clears and the two liquids have mixed into a crackling black slag, its feathery ashes overflowing the basin.

>inspect slag/interact slag

You spot a shine in the depths of the gravelly vessel, upon unearthing it you find a glistening black key. The key seems to absorb all light around it, except for eerily glowing scripture emblazoned in red on its handle: 'seventh son of magic, seventh son of time'
[get key]


[AFTER LEAVING THE FINAL TOWER]

You step back through the tower door into rising desert winds and you hear a distant creaking

[take a step]

the creaking grows louder, becoming a grinding rumble that you feel within your bones. The sky grows dark and the winds begin to rise, the sand stinging as it buffets around you

[take a step]
You feel a burning heat from your palm and look down to find your hourglass has shattered, it’s black grains swarming madly around in a pelting cloud.

[step]

as your feet sink into the sand a few more steps, The rumble explodes from behind you. Turning you hear the splintering roar as the colossal tower bends far beyond its structural integrity. Chunks ten times your size come tearing from its walls, and the shattering roar is only intensified as the other two towers twist in the same grotesque fashion. Screeching as if with otherworldly screams, their stony flesh begins ripping down into the sands.

The sands are violently tossing beneath your feet, sweeping towards the center point of all three disintegrating towers in a swirling maelstrom and you fall, being torn by their spinning torrent, consumed closer and closer to the center of the now descending waves of sand, as if being pulled into a flowing hourglass of catastrophe. The tiny shards fill your eyes, nose, ears and mouth, and you are pulled from the screaming world of sound and air into swirling tumbling darkness.


You awaken in darkness. The velvety blackness is absolute excepting a subtle glowing pulse coming from some distance away, northward.

>walk north

You feel another presence is here with you as you get closer to the glow.

>walk north

A small crystal, suspended in space, floats before you, casting a gentle light.

>walk north

a silvery presence surrounds the crystal.
